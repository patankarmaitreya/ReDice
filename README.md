Re/:Dice is a hyper casual platformer which teases your brain to maximize your scores. 
The Reset timer which can act as chance to get even higher score with the increased risk of death.
But the main bread and butter for the players is the ability "Roll Of The Dice" that has the potential to change your gameplay for the better or worse depending on a luck mechanic introduced by the casting of dice platform.
The Roll can either give you a platform with much higher points and a faster speed or one with lots of mines or a pltform with lot of mines all depending on the players luck.
